# SeedFormant
Seeding method for formant measurements using linear predictive coding (LPC).
- This method dynamically assigns vowel/segment-specific reference values for formant tracking. 
- This is a MATLAB code for calling Praat to run the LPC algorithm and Vitebi tracking with dynamic formant references (seeding method), instead of the default, schwa-like formant references. 

- You need to download Praat executive according to your OS and put it in the corresponding folder.
e.g., ./praat/windows/   ./praat/MAC/   ./praat/unix/
